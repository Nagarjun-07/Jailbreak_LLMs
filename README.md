# Jailbreaking LLM Simulation 
![WhatsApp Image 2025-07-02 at 22 24 44_a7fc3fa9](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/313f03c4-8b0f-4bb5-9f94-6bf1cd6ffb44)
A simplified implementation of adversarial attacks on safety-aligned Large Language Models (LLMs), inspired by the ICLR 2025 paper:  
**"Jailbreaking Leading Safety-Aligned LLMs with Simple Adaptive Attacks"**  

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **This project is strictly for educational and research purposes.** It demonstrates how LLMs can be evaluated for safety vulnerabilities without generating harmful content.

---

## Overview

This project tests the vulnerabilities of safety-aligned LLMs using:

- A dataset of 50 harmful prompts from **AdvBench**
- Prompt templates to simulate uncensored instructions
- A simplified **random search** to generate adversarial suffixes
- A **rule-based scoring system** to determine jailbreak success

Built using **Python** and **Google Colab**, it leverages **Gemini API** or optionally other LLMs.

## ‚ú® Features

- ‚úÖ Dropdown to select LLMs: `gemini-1.5-flash`, `gemini-1.5-pro`, `gemma-7b`
- ‚úÖ Dropdown for selecting dataset prompts or custom input
- ‚úÖ Lightweight **random search** with 50 iterations for adversarial suffixes
- ‚úÖ Rule-based evaluation: responses starting with ‚ÄúSure‚Äù score **10/10**
- ‚úÖ All requests use **"for educational and research purposes"** suffixes
